1) stream by location.                                                                                              DONE
    figure out API
    Can just pass in 4 location points in a list.
        Twitter wants a comma seperated list of latlong points.
        Twitter wants southwest corner coming first
        NOTE: google maps has long lat. We want lat long. (reverse them)


        SOUTHWEST US: (-124, 30)
        NORTHEAST US: ( -61, 49)

        THUS locations = [-124, 30, -61, 49]

        Perhaps specify for 50 different states. Just to get more datapoints.
2) 50 different states. Make seperate accounts for each.
3) figure out how to auto-restart script if something breaks it.                                                    
3) handle status_codes.
    only 200, 420, ... NOT very useful
4) handle ERROR codes
    more useful. listed at bottom of get_data.py. how to access them?
5) store data in db or whatever store
    figure out what db we all want to store data in.
    figure out schema
6) run periodically (cron job or continuously running python script? )
7) send email if there is an issue so we can figure out whats wrong.                                                DONE
8) perhaps only get ascii values?
9) https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types#disconnect_messages
    handle diff types of disconnect messages.
    other stuff on this page.
10) enable stall warnings.
    These help tell you when to cut down connection due to potential future issues
