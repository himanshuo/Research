1) stream by location.                                                                                              DONE
    figure out API
    Can just pass in 4 location points in a list.
        Twitter wants a comma seperated list of latlong points.
        Twitter wants southwest corner coming first
        NOTE: google maps has long lat. We want lat long. (reverse them)


        SOUTHWEST US: (-124, 30)
        NORTHEAST US: ( -61, 49)

        THUS locations = [-124, 30, -61, 49]
2) handle status_codes.
    only 200, 420, ... NOT very useful
3) handle ERROR codes
    more useful. listed at bottom of get_data.py. how to access them?
2) store data in db or whatever store
3) run periodically (cron job or continuously running python script? )
4) send email if there is an issue so we can figure out whats wrong.
5) perhaps only get ascii values?
6) https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types#disconnect_messages
    handle diff types of disconnect messages.
    other stuff on this page.
7) enable stall warnings.
    These help tell you when to cut down connection due to potential future issues
